A couple of years ago, I invited a homeless man to a house party. No idea why I did what I did, but since I had a decent amount of drugs in my system, I was like, the drugs made me do it. Because it was a house party where people were encouraged to wear costumes, I convinced the homeless man to wear my stormtrooper costume so that no one could see his face. I dressed up as Jesus.

However, by the end of our first year together, the relationship deteriorated ...
